Modifying [LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS) BLIP2 Q-former with models pretrained on Japanese datasets.

The model has been trained for stage1 using COCO dataset with [STAIR captions](http://captions.stair.center/#:~:text=STAIR%20Captions%20is%20a%20large,multimodal%20retrieval%2C%20and%20image%20generation.).

Sample captions generated by the model on COCO images can be found in playground.ipynb.
